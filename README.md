# Introduction of Bidding System on Facebook Marketplace

## Background

Facebook Marketplace, a platform designed for users to buy and sell goods regionally without intermediaries now planning to add bidding system to add fairness in the goods price. Historically, sellers had the autonomy to set prices, often resulting in price biases and ambiguity regarding fair market values. Recognizing the need for fairness and transparency, Facebook Marketplace introduced a novel bidding system. This system allows users to engage in competitive bidding, enabling market dynamics to dictate reasonable prices. Additionally, sellers can now directly communicate with potential buyers, taking into account factors such as the buyer's convenience in terms of time and location. These enhancements are expected to draw more users to the platform, enhance fairness, and potentially boost revenue for Facebook. By introducing a bidding system and personalized communication features, our project aims to create a more equitable and customer-centric marketplace environment, benefiting both buyers and sellers.

## Purpose

The introduction of a bidding system to Facebook Marketplace serves several key purposes. 

It's designed to establish a fair and transparent trading environment. Historically, sellers had the sole discretion to set prices, sometimes leading to ambiguity and unfairness. With the bidding system, prices are determined by market demand, ensuring fairness for both buyers and sellers. This initiative aims to enhance user engagement. By introducing an interactive bidding process, Facebook Marketplace becomes more dynamic and captivating. Users can actively participate in auctions, negotiate prices, and engage with others on the platform, making the overall experience more enjoyable and encouraging regular usage.

The bidding system is expected to attract a broader user base. The newfound interactivity and user-friendliness may draw in individuals who previously might not have considered using Facebook Marketplace, contributing to its growth and popularity. Which will lead to potential increase in the overall revenue.

## Scope

- Facebook intends to introduce this bidding system initially in the Boston area before making it available to all users. This phased rollout allows for testing and refining the feature in a specific region before wider implementation.
- The primary focus of the project revolves around the bidding system itself. It does not involve the handling of funds between buyers and sellers. Instead, the emphasis is placed on creating a fair and transparent bidding process.
- Users are not able to view bids placed by other users until they actively participate in the bidding process. This ensures that bids remain confidential until a user decides to engage.
- To express interest in an item, users must participate in the bidding process. This requirement encourages active engagement and interaction with the bidding system.
- The project's approach grants buyers the authority to choose to whom they want to sell their product. This decision-making power lies with the buyer, promoting user autonomy and personalized transactions within the platform.
