# Bidding System

## Background

- Currently the facebook marketplace does not have bidding system in place. The goal of the project is to extend the existing system to add the bidding feature to it

## Purpose


- Maximize the revenue
- Fairness in the price
- Decision-making


## Scope

- Delivery is ignored
- Holding the funds is assumed automatic and assumed that the system is inplace to hold the funds from the customers for bidding
- The auctioneer sets the time limit
- Users cannot bid higher than the ask price
- Assuming the no region limits - A product can be sold and can be bid from any where.
- A user can post a product for auction and the same user can bid on another.
- A user can only post 1 x product of same product type for simplicity
